Methods in java:
    Is just a collection of java statements and block of code like if else loop printlns etc.

Why should we learn about methods:
    1) it allows us to simplify large code as we can divide the logic in to smaller parts
    by creating methods for them, build those methods one by one and later on combine
    them to build complete applications
    2) methods allow us to re-use code.
    3) Methods allow us to be flexible.

How can we create methods?
    There are two types built-in and user defined

Built-in methods
    The methods which are designed by java developers
    for example the println, nextInt method in the scanner class length
    present in String class they are all built-in methods

User Defined Methods
    They are methods that we write

Methods which return something when called and others are
methods which are not return anything when called

int add(int a,int b){
return a+b
}
int => return type of a method
add => name of the method
(int a, int b) => parameters of the method or the input of the method
{ return a+b } => body of the method

Rules
    return type and the values that we are returning  from the method should match
    we can only assign methods to variable of same type

=================================================================================================

There are 3 types of variables with respect to their scope

Local variables:
    if a variable is created inside a block of code
    like a method, loop, if condition etc.
    they are called local variables
Upside:
    Local variables occupy  the memory for the shortest period of time,
    you should always try to write code with the help of local variables
Downside:
    they can not be accessed outside the block in which they are created. they have very limited scope


instance variables:
    all the variables which are created inside the class
    outside of methods are called instance variables
Upside:
    we can use them in all the instance methods of that class.
    their scope is larger than local variables
Downside:
    They stay longer in the memory as compared to local variables


Static variables:
    All the variables which are outside of methods and have
    the static keyword are called static variables
